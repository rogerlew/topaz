 THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF DEFINITIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE COLUMN NUMBERS
 IN THE TABLE.
 
 1.  NODE (ALSO SUBCATCHMENT) COUNTER.
 2.  STRAHLER ORDER OF THE CHANNEL LINK IN WHICH THE SUBCATCHMENT DRAINS.
 3.  NODE INDEX NUMBER.
 4.  MEAN OF THE TERRAIN SLOPE OF THE SOURCE SUBCATCHMENT.
     THE MEAN IS COMPUTED BY SUMMATION OVER ALL CELLS IN THE SUBCATCHMENT DIVIDED
     BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 5.  MEAN OF THE TERRAIN SLOPE OF THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT .
     THE MEAN IS COMPUTED BY SUMMATION OVER ALL CELLS IN THE SUBCATCHMENT DIVIDED
     BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 6.  MEAN OF THE TERRAIN SLOPE OF THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT .
     THE MEAN IS COMPUTED BY SUMMATION OVER ALL CELLS IN THE SUBCATCHMENT DIVIDED
     BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 7.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE IN THE SOURCE AREA, WHERE EACH FLOW PATH SLOPE
     IS COMPUTED BY SUMMING THE FLOW VECTOR ALONG THE FLOW PATH FROM THE
     SOURCE CELL TO THE CHANNEL, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 8.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE IN THE RIGHT AREA, WHERE EACH FLOW PATH SLOPE
     IS COMPUTED BY SUMMING THE FLOW VECTOR ALONG THE FLOW PATH FROM THE
     SOURCE CELL TO THE CHANNEL, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 9.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE IN THE LEFT AREA, WHERE EACH FLOW PATH SLOPE
     IS COMPUTED BY SUMMING THE FLOW VECTOR ALONG THE FLOW PATH FROM THE
     SOURCE CELL TO THE CHANNEL, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 10. MEAN CELL SLOPE IN THE SOURCE AREA, WHERE EACH CELL SLOPE
     IS COMPUTED BY SUMMING THE FLOW VECTOR ALONG THE FLOW PATH FROM
     EVERY CELL TO THE CHANNEL, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 11. MEAN CELL SLOPE IN THE RIGHT AREA, WHERE EACH CELL SLOPE
     IS COMPUTED BY SUMMING THE FLOW VECTOR ALONG THE FLOW PATH FROM
     EVERY CELL TO THE CHANNEL, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 12. MEAN CELL SLOPE IN THE LEFT AREA, WHERE EACH CELL SLOPE
     IS COMPUTED BY SUMMING THE FLOW VECTOR ALONG THE FLOW PATH FROM
     EVERY CELL TO THE CHANNEL, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS.
 13. MEAN SLOPE IN THE SOURCE AREA, WHERE SLOPE IS COMPUTED BY
     DETERMINING THE MEAN ELEVATION OF THE SUBCATCHMENT, DETERMINING
     THE ELEVATION OF THE CHANNEL SOURCE, THE DIVIDING THE DIFFERENCE
     BY THE DISTANCE-TO-CENTER OF MOMENT.
 14. MEAN SLOPE IN THE RIGHT AREA, WHERE SLOPE IS COMPUTED BY
     DETERMINING THE MEAN ELEVATION OF THE SUBCATCHMENT, DETERMINING
     THE MEAN ELEVATION OF THE CHANNEL, THE DIVIDING THE DIFFERENCE
     BY THE DISTANCE-TO-CENTER OF MOMENT.
 15. MEAN SLOPE IN THE LEFT AREA, WHERE SLOPE IS COMPUTED BY
     DETERMINING THE MEAN ELEVATION OF THE SUBCATCHMENT, DETERMINING
     THE MEAN ELEVATION OF THE CHANNEL, THE DIVIDING THE DIFFERENCE
     BY THE DISTANCE-TO-CENTER OF MOMENT.
 
 ** NOTE **
 
 - BECAUSE THERE MAY BE JUNCTIONS WITH MULTIPLE TRIBUTARIES, THE NUMBER
   OF SUBCATCHMENTS MAY BE SMALLER THAN THE THEORETICALLY EXPECTED NUMBER.
 
 - THE LAST LINE OF DATA DOES NOT REPRESENT A SUBCATCHMENT.
   IT REPRESENTS THE WATERSHED OUTLET CELL.
 
 - VALUE OF -1 INDICATES TERM NOT APPLICABLE.
