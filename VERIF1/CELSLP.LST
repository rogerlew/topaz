 THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF DEFINITIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE COLUMN NUMBERS
 IN THE TABLE.
 
 ** SLOPE ALTERNATIVE ONE
 SLOPE ALTERNATIVE ONE (COL 4, 5, 6) CORRESPONDS TO THE MEAN CELL-TO-CHANNEL
 SLOPE WHERE THE CELL-TO-CHANNEL SLOPE IS CALCULATED BY SUMMING THE FLOW
 VECTORS ALONG THE FLOW PATHS FROM THE CELL TO THE CHANNEL DIVIDED BY THE
 NUMBER OF CELLS.
 
 ** SLOPE ALTERNATIVE TWO
 SLOPE ALTERNATIVE TWO (COL 7, 8, 9) CORRESPONDS TO THE MEAN CELL-TO-CHANNEL
 SLOPE WHERE CELL TO CHANNEL SLOPE IS CALCULATED BY THE ELEVATION DROP FROM
 EACH CELL TO CHANNEL DIVIDED BY THE DISTANCE FROM CELL-TO-CHANNEL
 
 ** SLOPE ALTERNATIVE THREE
 SLOPE ALTERNATIVE THREE (COL 10, 11, 12) CORRESPONDS TO THE MEAN CELL-TO-CHANNEL
 SLOPE CALCULATED AS THE MEAN ELEVATION DROP OF ALL CELL-TO-CHANNEL ELEVATION DROPS
 DROPS, DIVIDED BY THE MEAN DISTANCE OF ALL CELL-TO-CHANNEL FLOW PATHS.
 
 1.  NODE (ALSO SUBCATCHMENT) COUNTER.
 2.  STRAHLER ORDER OF THE CHANNEL LINK INTO WHICH THE SUBCATCHMENT DRAINS.
 3.  NODE INDEX NUMBER.
 4.  MEAN CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE ONE) SLOPE OF THE SOURCE SUBCATCHMENT.
 5.  MEAN CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE ONE) SLOPE OF THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT.
 6.  MEAN CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE ONE) SLOPE OF THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT.
 7.  MEAN OF ALL CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE TWO) SLOPES FOR THE SOURCE SUBCATCHMENT.
 8.  MEAN OF ALL CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE TWO) SLOPES FOR THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT.
 9.  MEAN OF ALL CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE TWO) SLOPES FOR THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT.
 10. MEAN OF ALL CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE THREE) SLOPES FOR THE SOURCE SUBCATCHMENT.
 11. MEAN OF ALL CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE THREE) SLOPES FOR THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT.
 12. MEAN OF ALL CELL-TO-CHANNEL (ALTERNATIVE THREE) SLOPES FOR THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT.
 
 ** NOTE **
 
 - BECAUSE THERE MAY BE JUNCTIONS WITH MULTIPLE TRIBUTARIES, THE NUMBER
   OF SUBCATCHMENTS MAY BE SMALLER THAN THE THEORETICALLY EXPECTED NUMBER.
 
 - THE LAST LINE OF DATA DOES NOT REPRESENT A SUBCATCHMENT.
   IT REPRESENTS THE WATERSHED OUTLET CELL.
 
 - VALUE OF -1 INDICATES TERM NOT APPLICABLE.
