 THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF DEFINITIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE COLUMN NUMBERS
 IN THE TABLE.
 
 ** SLOPE ALTERNATIVE ONE
 SLOPE ALTERNATIVE ONE (COL 4, 5, 6) CORRESPONDS TO THE MEAN FLOW PATH
 SLOPE WHERE EACH FLOW PATH SLOPE IS CALCULATED BY SUMMING THE FLOW
 SLOPES ALONG THE FLOW PATH DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CELLS
 
 ** SLOPE ALTERNATIVE TWO
 SLOPE ALTERNATIVE TWO (COL 7, 8, 9) CORRESPONDS TO THE MEAN FLOW PATH
 SLOPE WHERE EACH FLOW PATH SLOPE IS CALCULATED AS THE ELEVATION DROP
 FROM SOURCE-CELL TO CHANNEL DIVIDED BY THE DISTANCE FROM SOURCE-CELL
 TO CHANNEL.
 
 ** SLOPE ALTERNATIVE THREE
 SLOPE ALTERNATIVE THREE (COL 10, 11, 12) CORRESPONDS TO THE MEAN FLOW PATH
 SLOPE CALCULATED AS THE MEAN ELEVATION DROP OF ALL FLOW PATH FROM CELL TO
 CHANNEL DIVIDED BY THE MEAN OF ALL FLOW PATH LENGTH FROM CELL TO CHANNEL
 
 1.  NODE (ALSO SUBCATCHMENT) COUNTER.
 2.  STRAHLER ORDER OF THE CHANNEL LINK INTO WHICH THE SUBCATCHMENT DRAINS.
 3.  NODE INDEX NUMBER.
 4.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE ONE) OF THE SOURCE SUBCATCHMENT.
 5.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE ONE) OF THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT.
 6.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE ONE) OF THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT.
 7.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE TWO) FOR THE SOURCE SUBCATCHMENT.
 8.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE TWO) FOR THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT.
 9.  MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE TWO) FOR THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT.
 10. MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE THREE) FOR THE SOURCE SUBCATCHMENT.
 11. MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE THREE) FOR THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT.
 12. MEAN FLOW PATH SLOPE (ALTERNATIVE THREE) FOR THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT.
 
 ** NOTE **
 
 - BECAUSE THERE MAY BE JUNCTIONS WITH MULTIPLE TRIBUTARIES, THE NUMBER
   OF SUBCATCHMENTS MAY BE SMALLER THAN THE THEORETICALLY EXPECTED NUMBER.
 
 - THE LAST LINE OF DATA DOES NOT REPRESENT A SUBCATCHMENT.
   IT REPRESENTS THE WATERSHED OUTLET CELL.
 
 - VALUE OF -1 INDICATES TERM NOT APPLICABLE.
