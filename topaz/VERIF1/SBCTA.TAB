 PERTAINING TO THE FIRST NODE NUMBER IS GIVEN.  SUBSEQUENT NODES
 ARE HYPOTHETICAL NODES AND HAVE NO CORRESPONDING SUBCATCHMENT INFORMATION.

 THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF DEFINITIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE COLUMN NUMBERS
 IN THE TABLE.
 
 THE SUBCATCHMENT AREA IS CALCULATED BY SUMMING THE CELL AREAS THAT ARE WITHIN
 A SUBCATCHMENT.
 
 1.  NODE (ALSO SUBCATCHMENT) COUNTER.
 2.  STRAHLER ORDER OF THE CHANNEL LINK INTO WHICH THE SUBCATCHMENT DRAINS.
 3.  NODE INDEX NUMBER.
 4.  DRAINAGE AREA OF THE SOURCE AREA SUBCATCHMENT IN NUMBER OF CELLS.
 5.  DRAINAGE AREA OF THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT IN NUMBER OF CELLS WITHOUT
     CHANNEL CELL AREA.
 6.  DRAINAGE AREA OF THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT IN NUMBER OF CELLS WITHOUT
     CHANNEL CELL AREA.
 7.  AREA DEFINING THE CHANNEL IN NUMBER OF CELLS.
 8.  SUM OF THE ABOVE FOUR AREAS INTO TOTAL DIRECT DRAINAGE AREA IN NUMBER
     OF CELLS FOR THE CHANNEL LINK.
 9.  DRAINAGE AREA OF THE SOURCE AREA SUBCATCHMENT IN NUMBER OF CELLS.
 10. DRAINAGE AREA OF THE LEFT SUBCATCHMENT INCLUDING 1/2 OF THE CHANNEL
     AREA IN NUMBER OF CELLS.
 11. DRAINAGE AREA OF THE RIGHT SUBCATCHMENT INCLUDING 1/2 OF THE CHANNEL
     AREA IN NUMBER OF CELLS.
 12. SUM OF THE ABOVE THREE AREAS INTO TOTAL DIRECT DRAINAGE AREA IN NUMBER
     OF CELLS FOR THE CHANNEL LINK.
 
 ** NOTE **
 
 - BECAUSE THERE MAY BE JUNCTIONS WITH MULTIPLE TRIBUTARIES, THE NUMBER
   OF SUBCATCHMENTS MAY BE SMALLER THAN THE THEORETICALLY EXPECTED NUMBER.
 
 - THE LAST LINE OF DATA DOES NOT REPRESENT A SUBCATCHMENT.
   IT REPRESENTS THE WATERSHED OUTLET CELL.
 
 - THE SUBCATCHMENT AREAS INTO THE OUTLET CELL ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE
   LAST CHANNEL LINK (PREVIOUS TO LAST DATA LINE).
   AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OF THE SUBCATCHMENT AREAS OF THE LAST CHANNEL
   LINK INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THEIR OWN SUBCATCHMENT AREAS, THE SUBCATCHMENT
   AREAS INTO THE OUTLET CELL.
 
 - VALUE OF -1 INDICATES TERM NOT APPLICABLE.
