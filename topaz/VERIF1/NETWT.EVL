 NOTE 1: - FOR THE CONDITION WHERE THE WATERSHED OUTLET IS A SIMPLE
           OR COMPLEX JUNCTION, AN ADDITIONAL SHORT CHANNEL LINK AND
           CORRESPONDING OUTLET NODE (WITHOUT A JUNCTION) IS ADDED AT THE
           WATERSHED OUTLET OF THE BINARY NETWORK.  AS A, RESULT THE TOTAL
           LENGTH OF THE INT. CHANNELS AND OF THE NETWORK IS SLIGHTLY LONGER,
           AND TOTAL DRAINAGE AREA IS SLIGHTLY LARGER.  PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM
           CHANNEL LENGTH AND AREA VALUES, SUCH AS DRAINAGE DENSITY OR SLOPE,
           MAY, AS A RESULT, ALSO DISPLAY A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WHEN COMPARED
           TO THE RASTER NETWORK.
           FOR THE CONDITION WHERE THE WATERSHED OUTLET IS A COMPLEX JUNCTION,
           ONE OR SEVERAL ADDITIONAL SHORT CHANNEL LINKS BEYOND THE ONE JUST
           DESCRIBED MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPLEX JUNCTION.
           THE SUMMATION OF ALL THE SHORT CHANNEL LINKS AND CORRESPONDING
           DRAINAGE AREAS THAT ARE CREATED AS DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTE 1
           WILL ALWAYS BE LESS THAN THAT OF ONE RASTER CELL.
 
 NOTE 2: - NUMBER OF CHANNEL LINKS, LENGTH, ELEVATION, SLOPE, DRAINAGE AREA,
           DENSITY, AND NETWORK COMPOSITION VALUES ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER
           OF ADDITIONAL CHANNEL LINKS DUE TO THE DECOMPOSITION OF COMPLEX
           JUNCTIONS INTO A SEQENCE OF SIMPLE JUNCTIONS.
 
 NOTE 3: - THE ADDITIONAL CHANNEL LINKS ARE CREATED DUE TO:
           A) THE DECOMPOSITION OF COMPLEX JUNCTIONS INTO A SEQUENCE
              OF SIMPLE JUNCTIONS; AND,
           B) THE PRESENCE OF A COMPLEX OR SIMPLE JUNCTION AT THE OUTLET AS
              DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1.
           THE FIRST VALUE GIVEN IS THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL CHANNEL LINKS
           ESTIMATED FROM THE RASTER NETWORK, AND THE SECOND VALUE IS THE
           ACTUAL NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL CHANNEL LINKS IN THE BINARY NETWORK.
 
 NOTE 4: - OVERALL DRAINAGE DENSITY REFERS TO TOTAL CHANNEL LENGTH DIVIDED BY
           CORRESPONDING TOTAL DIRECT DRAINAGE AREA.  OVERALL DRAINAGE DENSITY
           CORRESPONDS TO THE MEAN OF THE AREA WEIGHTED DRAINAGE DENSITY OF THE
           INDIVIDUAL CHANNEL LINKS.
           MEAN DRAINAGE DENSITY REFERS TO THE AVERAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL
           CHANNEL LINK LENGTHS OVER CORRESPONDING DIRECT DRAINAGE AREAS.
 
 NOTE 5: - UPSTREAM DRAINAGE AREA FOR FIRST ORDER CHANNELS INCLUDES SOURCE
           AREA ONLY; FOR ALL OTHER ORDER CHANNELS THE UPSTREAM AREA IS THAT
           DEFINED BY THE TWO UPSTREAM INFLOW CHANNELS; IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE
           DIRECT OVERLAND AREA FLOWING DIRECTLY INTO THE UPSTREAM NODE OF THE
           CHANNEL LINK.
