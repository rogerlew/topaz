 CAPABILITIES, LIMITATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS OF SOFTWARE TOPAZ:
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM PROCESSES THE RASTER DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL (DEM) OF
   A WATERSHED TO DEFINE THE DRAINAGE NETWORK, SUBDIVIDE THE WATERSHED INTO
   SUBCATCHMENTS, AND EXTRACT SELECTED CHANNEL AND SUBCATCHMENT GEOMETRIC
   PARAMETERS.  THE DEM SHOULD REPRESENT LANDSCAPES THAT ARE DISSECTED BY
   CONCENTRATED-FLOW CHANNELS AND THAT DISPLAY SUFFICIENT RELIEF TO
   TOPOGRAPHICALLY DEFINE FLOW CONVERGENCE AND DOWNSTREAM FLOW PATHS.
   INCLINED AND PERFECTLY FLAT SURFACES WITHIN THE DIGITAL LANDSCAPE ARE
   ACCEPTED BY PROGRAM DEDNM, BUT THE ABSENCE OF ANY DETAILED RELIEF OVER
   LARGE SURFACES MAY RESULT IN LOCAL FLOW PATHS THAT DEVIATE FROM ACTUAL
   CONDITIONS.
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM EXTRACTS THE FOLLOWING RASTER IMAGES FROM A GIVEN DEM:
   * WATERSHED INPUT ELEVATIONS AFTER AGGREGATION OR RESAMPLING;
   * WATERSHED ELEVATIONS AFTER AGGREGATION OR RESAMPLING, AND SMOOTHING;
   * WATERSHED ELEVATIONS AFTER AGGREGATION OR RESAMPLING, SMOOTHING, AND
     DEPRESSION ANALYSIS, DEPRESSION OUTLET ADJUSTMENT, AND FILLING;
   * WATERSHED ELEVATIONS AFTER AGGREGATION OR RESAMPLING, SMOOTHING,
     DEPRESSION ANALYSIS, DEPRESSION OUTLET ADJUSTMENT, FILLING, AND RELIEF
     MODIFICATION TO ESTABLISH POSITIVE DRAINAGE IN FLAT AREAS;
   * LOCAL FLOW VECTORS;
   * FLOW PATH CODES;
   * DEFINITION OF FLOW PATHS (BEGINNING AND ENDING POINTS);
   * LOCAL UPSTREAM DIRECT DRAINAGE AREAS;
   * CODES FOR CSA AND MSCL PARAMETERS AFTER AGGREGATION OR RESAMPLING;
   * DRAINAGE NETWORK FOR ENTIRE DEM COVERAGE;
   * OUTLINE OF WATERSHED;
   * DRAINAGE NETWORK WITH STRAHLER ORDERS WITHIN WATERSHED BOUNDARIES ONLY;
   * SUBCATCHMENT LOCATION, EXTENT AND INDEXES, WITHIN WATERSHED BOUNDARIES
     ONLY, INCLUDING DRAINAGE NETWORK.
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING REPORT AND TABULAR OUTPUT:
   * REPORT OF PROGRAM EXECUTION FOR PROGRAM DEDNM;
   * TABLE OF GEOMETRIC AND TOPOLOGIC CHANNEL PARAMETERS;
   * TABLE OF SUBCATCHMENT AREA PARAMETERS;
   * TABLE OF SUBCATCHMENT WINDOW SITES.
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE INDEXING OF THE CHANNEL LINKS AND
   SUBCATCHMENTS.  THIS INDEXING (NUMBERING) FOLLOWS THE SCHEME DESCRIBED IN:
   DETERMINATION OF THE EXECUTION SEQUENCE OF CHANNELS IN A DRAINAGE
   NETWORK FOR CASCADE ROUTING; J. GARBRECHT; 1988; HYDROSOFT; SOFTWARE
   FOR HYDRAULICS, HYDROLOGY AND HYDRODYNAMICS; COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS
   PUBLICATIONS; VOL. 1, NO. 3, JULY 1988.
 
 - THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SOURCES OF A GENERATED DRAINAGE NETWORK REQUIRES
   THE INPUT OF A CRITICAL SOURCE AREA (CSA), I.E. A REPRESENTATIVE
   THRESHOLD (MINIMUM) DRAINAGE AREA AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH A SOURCE
   CHANNEL (1ST ORDER CHANNEL) IS INITIATED AND MAINTAINED.  ALSO
   REQUIRED IS A MINIMUM SOURCE CHANNEL LENGTH (MSCL) FOR FIRST ORDER CHANNELS
   TO BE CLASSIFIED AS FIRST ORDER CHANNELS.  BOTH THESE INPUT PARAMETERS
   CAN BE USED TO INTRODUCE THE EFFECT OF SCALE AND RESOLUTION INTO THE DEM
   PROCESSING.  THE DRAINAGE NETWORK, THE ORDER OF THE NETWORK, THE DRAINAGE
   DENSITY, THE CHANNEL GEOMETRIC PARAMETERS, THE WATERSHED SUBDIVISION AND
   THE SUBCATCHMENT GEOMETRIC PARAMETERS ARE ALL A FUNCTION OF THESE TWO INPUT
   PARAMETERS.  THE CSA AND MSCL PARAMETERS CAN BE PROVIDED AS SPATIALLY
   VARIABLE PARAMETERS.  UP TO 5 DIFFERENT VALUES ARE ALLOWED TO GENERATE A
   DRAINAGE NETWORK WITH SPATIALLY VARIABLE CHARACTERISTICS.
 
 - THE BASIC UNITS OF PROGRAM DEDNM ARE METERS FOR LENGTHS AND HECTARES
   FOR AREAS;  ELEVATION VALUES ARE ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST DECIMETER.
   THIS ROUNDING IS NECESSARY TO ALLOW THE TREATMENT OF FLAT AREAS WITH
   INDETERMINATE FLOW PATHS.  THIS TREATMENT USES ELEVATION INCREMENTS
   SMALLER THAN A DECIMETER (0.01 MILLIMETERS) TO IMPOSE LIKELY FLOW
   GRADIENTS ON FLAT AREAS.
 
 - THE DEM MUST BE OF SUFFICIENT VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION TO
   FULLY DEFINE THE DETAILS OF THE FEATURES THAT ARE TO BE EXTRACTED.
 
 - THE DRAINAGE NETWORK LOCATION AND EXTENT IS DEFINED BY STRINGS OF CELLS.
   THE WIDTH OF A CHANNEL CANNOT BE INFERRED FROM THE CELLS THAT IDENTIFY
   THE EXISTENCE OF A CHANNEL.  ALSO, CELL VALUES REPRESENT THE
   AVERAGE ELEVATION UNDER THE ENTIRE CELL, AND THEREFORE THEY MAY NOT
   BE REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL CHANNEL THALWEG ELEVATIONS.  THIS IS
   PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR NARROW INCISED CHANNELS THAT ARE OF THE SAME
   ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OR SMALLER THAN THE CELL SIZE.  THIS CAN LEAD TO
   POOR APPROXIMATIONS OF CHANNEL SLOPE VALUES.  SIMILARLY, CHANNEL
   SINUOSITY WITHIN A VALLEY CAN ONLY BE PROPERLY REPRODUCED IF THE CELL
   SIZE AND ELEVATIONS CAN REFLECT THE SINUOUS PATTERN OF THE CHANNEL.
   THE SINUOSITY OF THE VALLEY BETWEEN LATERAL RISING TERRAIN IS ALWAYS
   REPRODUCED.
 
 - THE OUTPUT OF THIS PROGRAM QUANTIFIES THE DIGITAL LANDSCAPE (INPUT DEM)
   WHICH MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE ACTUAL
   LANDSCAPE.  IF THE INPUT DEM IS OF POOR QUALITY OR RESOLUTION AND DOES
   NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE LANDSCAPE CONDITIONS, THEN THE OUTPUT OF THIS
   PROGRAM CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A GOOD CHARACTERIZATION OF THE
   ACTUAL LANDSCAPE.
 
 - LANDSCAPE DRAINAGE PATTERNS EXTRACTED BY PROGRAM DEDNM MAY NOT BE SUITABLE
   FOR FLOW ANALYSIS IF RUNOFF GRADIENTS ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY
   LANDSCAPE TOPOGRAPHY, AS IN THE PRESENCE OF BACKWATER OR TIDAL EFFECTS,
   WHICH MAY HAVE WATER SURFACE GRADIENTS THAT ARE REVERSE TO THE
   TERRAIN GRADIENTS.
 
 - THE WATERSHED OF INTEREST MUST BE ENTIRELY INCLUDED IN THE DEM AND SHOULD
   NOT TOUCH THE EDGE OF THE DEM.  IF IT DOES TOUCH THE EDGE OF THE DEM OR
   IF IT IS ADJACENT TO AND AREA OF INDETERMINATE ELEVATIONS, THEN IT IS
   LIKELY THAT THE TRUE WATERSHED BOUNDARIES EXTEND BEYOND THE DEM
   BOUNDARIES OR INTO THE AREA OF INDETERMINATE ELEVATIONS.  UNDER THESE
   CONDITIONS THE COMPUTED WATERSHED BOUNDARIES, DRAINAGE NETWORK AND
   SUBCATCHMENTS WOULD BE INCOMPLETE.  THE USER MAY HOWEVER OVERRIDE THE
   PROGRAM TERMINATION AND PROCEED WITH THE LIKELY INCOMPLETE WATERSHED.
 
 - THE USER MUST PROVIDE A ROW COLUMN-CELL COORDINATE THAT IDENTIFIES THE
   WATERSHED OUTLET.  FOR NUMERICAL REASONS THE WATERSHED OUTLET CANNOT BE
   SITUATED ON THE EDGE OF THE DEM.
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM IS BASED ON THE D-8 METHOD (DETERMINISTIC 8 NEIGHBORS).
   ALL ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATION OF THE D-8 METHOD APPLY (FAIRFIELD AND
   LEYMARIE, 1991; COSTA-CABRAL AND BURGES, 1994).  PARTICULARLY, THE FLOW
   DIRECTION AT ANY ONE CELL CAN BE IN ERROR BY AS MUCH AS 22.5 DEGREES.
   HOWEVER, IN DISSECTED LANDSCAPES WITH CONVERGENT FLOW THE GENERAL
   DRAINAGE DIRECTION OVER THE DISTANCE OF SEVERAL CELLS IS RELATIVELY WELL
   REPRODUCED BECAUSE BEGINNING AND ENDING POINTS OF DRAINAGE PATHS ARE
   LOCATION CONTROLLED AND NOT LIMITED TO THE 8 DIRECTIONS THAT APPLY TO A
   SINGLE CELL.  ALSO, THE D-8 METHOD IS NOT CAPABLE OF HANDLING DIVERGENT
   FLOW.
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM IS BASED ON THE DOWNSLOPE FLOW ROUTING CONCEPT.  AS SUCH
   UPSTREAM DRAINAGE AREAS AND DRAINAGE PATHS ARE ASSUMED TO BE ADEQUATELY
   DESCRIBE BY DOWNSLOPE FLOW ROUTING FROM ONE CELL SPILLING ONTO THE
   NEIGHBORING CELL LOCATED IN THE DIRECTION OF STEEPEST DESCENT.
 
 - CALIBRATION IS NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE THE EXTRACTED DRAINAGE NETWORK AND
   SUBCATCHMENT PARAMETERS WITH REGARD TO FIELD CONDITIONS.  THE USER MAY
   SPEED-UP PROGRAM EXECUTION FOR CALIBRATION PURPOSES BY CHOOSING THE
   CALIBRATION OPTION.  HOWEVER, THE USER MUST HAVE MADE AT LEAST ONE INITIAL
   FULL RUN OF PROGRAM DEDNM BEFORE THE CALIBRATION OPTION CAN BE EXERCISED.
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM ACCEPTS ONLY RASTER CELLS THAT ARE SQUARES.
 
 - THE ELEVATION VALUES IN THE DEM MUST BE POSITIVE INTEGER OR DECIMAL
   NUMBERS; THE ELEVATION VALUE OF ZERO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
 
 - IF DESIRED BY THE USER, THE INPUT DEM CAN BE AGGREGATED OR RESAMPLED INTO
   ONE WITH A COARSER GRID DURING THE INITIAL READING OF THE DEM DATA.
   THIS AGGREGATION OR RESAMPLING MAY BE DESIRABLE TO OVERCOME MACHINE MEMORY,
   OPERATING SYSTEM AND EXECUTION SPEED LIMITATIONS.
 
 - WHEN AGGREGATION IS PERFORMED, THE AGGREGATION OF THE INPUT DEM INTO
   ONE WITH A COARSER GRID IS ACCOMPLISHED BY LINEAR AVERAGING OF RASTER
   ELEVATION VALUES OVER A SQUARE HAVING THE SAME NUMBER OF HORIZONTAL
   AND VERTICAL RASTER CELLS (NNOD).  THE USER CANNOT AGGREGATE OVER
   A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL RASTER CELLS.
   THE MAXIMUM NUMBER FOR NNOD IS CURRENTLY SET TO 20 (A SQUARE OF
   400 RASTER CELLS).  THIS VALUE CAN BE CHANGED WITH VERY MINOR CHANGES
   TO THE SOFTWARE.
 
 - WHEN RESAMPLING IS PERFORMED, THE RESAMPLING OF THE INPUT DEM INTO ONE
   WITH A COARSER GRID IS ACCOMPLISHED BY SELECTING THE DEM ELEVATION VALUE
   OF THE CENTER CELL OF THE RESAMPLING BOX (NNOD*NNOD).  IF THIS ELEVATION
   IS INDETERMINATE, THEN THE DEM ELEVATION VALUE OF THE CELL WHICH IS
   CLOSEST TO THE CENTER AND WHICH HAS A VALID DEM ELEVATION VALUE IS PICKED
   AS THE RESAMPLED VALUE.
 
 - IF AGGREGATION OR RESAMPLING IS PERFORMED ON THE INPUT DEM ELEVATIONS,
   THEN A CORRESPONDING AGGREGATION OR RESAMPLING IS PERFORMED ON THE
   INPUT CODES FOR THE CSA AND MSCL PARAMETERS.  AGGREGATION IS ACCOMPLISHED
   BY RETAINING THE MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURRING CODE VALUE IN THE AGGREGATION
   WINDOW, AND RESAMPLING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY SELECTING THE CODE VALUE AT
   THE CENTER OR CLOSEST TO THE CENTER OF THE RESAMPLING WINDOW.
 
 - IF DESIRED BY THE USER, THE ENTERED ELEVATION DATA CAN BE SMOOTHED
   USING A WEIGHTED, SINGLE OR MULTIPLE PASS, 3 BY 3 BOX-CAR FILTER.
   THE CELL WEIGHTING AND NUMBER OF SMOOTHING PASSES IS USER PROVIDED.
   AFTER SMOOTHING THE ELEVATION DATA IS ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST DECIMETER.
   THIS ROUNDING IS NECESSARY TO ALLOW THE TREATMENT OF FLAT AREAS WITH
   INDETERMINATE FLOW PATHS.
 
   BOTH TYPES OF DEPRESSIONS ARE ANALYZED, FILLED AND TREATED AS FLAT
   SURFACES.  IF DESIRED BY THE USER, THE OUTLET OF IMPOUNDMENT DEPRESSIONS
   CAN BE ANALYZED AND MODIFIED IF THE NARROW SWELL OR LOCAL BLOCKAGE DOES
   NOT EXCEED TWO CELLS IN WIDTH.  UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE SWELL
   OR BLOCKAGE CAN BE LOWERED TO THE LEVEL OF THE HIGHEST OF THE TWO ADJACENT
   CELL ELEVATIONS THAT DEFINE THE SWELL OR BLOCKAGE.
 
 - FLAT AREAS IN THE DEM ELEVATION DATA (INCLUDING FLAT AREAS AS A RESULT OF
   DEPRESSION FILLING) ARE MODIFIED TO PRODUCE THE MOST LIKELY DRAINAGE PATHS
   AND TO PRODUCE A FULLY CONNECTED DRAINAGE NETWORK.  THE MODIFICATIONS ARE
   A FUNCTION OF THE FALLING AND RISING TERRAIN THAT SURROUNDS THE FLAT AREA.
   THE RELIEF MODIFICATION USES INCREMENTAL ELEVATIONS OF 2/100,000 OF A
   DEM ELEVATION UNIT (1 METER) TO BUILD GRADIENTS OVER FLAT SURFACES THAT
   DRAIN FLOW AWAY FROM RISING TERRAIN AND TOWARDS THE NEAREST OUTLET OF
   THE FLAT SURFACE.  THIS ALSO PROMOTES FLOW CONVERGENCE.  IN MOST CASES
   THE FINAL ELEVATION INCREMENTATION IS NOT EXPECTED TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL
   TOPOGRAPHY BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT, YET IT IS SUFFICIENT TO REMOVE
   THE DRAINAGE INDETERMINACY OF FLAT AREAS.  FLAT AREAS THAT ARE OVER
   1500 CELLS LONG MAY BE EXCESSIVELY LARGE AND MAY EXCEED THE CAPABILITIES
   OF THE ALGORITHM.
 
 - THE EDGE OF THE DEM IS CONSIDERED A SPECIAL BOUNDARY.  RASTER CELLS ON
   THE EDGE OF THE DEM THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY NEIGHBOR AT A LOWER ELEVATION
   ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE A FLOW VECTOR POINTING OFF THE DEM.
 
 - THE DEPRESSION FILLED AND RELIEF CORRECTED ELEVATIONS, THE FLOW VECTORS,
   FLOW PATH CODES, THE UPSTREAM AREAS AND THE DRAINAGE NETWORK ARE
   COMPUTED FOR THE ENTIRE DEM RASTER.  THE FOLLOWING RASTERS AND PARAMETERS
   ARE COMPUTED FOR THE DRAINAGE AREA UPSTREAM OF A USER SPECIFIED POINT
   (USUALLY THE WATERSHED OUTLET POINT): THE FULLY CONNECTED DRAINAGE
   NETWORK, THE WATERSHED SUBDIVISION, THE SUBCATCHMENTS AND ALL
   CORRESPONDING NETWORK, CHANNEL AND SUBCATCHMENT PARAMETERS.
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM DOES NOT HAVE GIS DISPLAY CAPABILITIES.
 
 - PROGRAM DEDNM IS AN INTERACTIVE PROGRAM WRITTEN IN FORTRAN 90.  THE
   INTERACTIVE PORTION OF THE PROGRAM REQUIRES THE USER TO DEFINE THE EXACT
   LOCATION OF THE WATERSHED OUTLET GIVEN A DISPLAY OF THE COMPUTED
   CHANNEL NETWORK.
 
 - THE SIZE OF THE DEM THAT CAN BE PROCESSED BY PROGRAM DEDNM IS LIMITED BY
   THE ACCESSIBLE MACHINE MEMORY AND OPERATING SYSTEM LIMITATIONS
   UNDER WHICH PROGRAM DEDNM IS COMPILED AND EXECUTED.  THE SIZE OF THE
   DEM (IN NUMBER OF ROWS AND COLUMNS) IS SET DYNAMICALLY BY THE PROGRAM AS
   A FUNCTION OF USER INPUT OF NUMBER OF ROWS AND COLUMNS FOR THE DEM.
 
 - THE SIZE OF THE INTEGER ELEVATION VALUES OF THE DEM MUST BE COMPATIBLE
   WITH THE COMPILER LIMITATIONS REGARDING THE REPRESENTATION AND
   PROCESSING OF INTEGER VALUES.  CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE
   FACT THAT, FOR COMPUTATIONAL PURPOSES, THE INPUT ELEVATION VALUES
   ARE INTERNALLY MULTIPLIED BY 100,000 (TO ALLOW THE TREATMENT OF LOW
   RELIEF TERRAIN).  THEREFORE, A 32 BIT INTEGER (INTEGER*4) REPRESENTATION
   MUST BE USED.  THE 32 BIT INTEGER REPRESENTATION CAN PROCESS ELEVATION
   VALUES BETWEEN 1.0 AND +9,999.0 METERS.
 
 - THE SIZE OF THE WATERSHED AREA, IN NUMBER OF CELLS, MUST BE WITHIN
   THE RANGE OF VALUES THAT CAN BE REPRESENTED BY AN INTEGER*4 NUMBER
   (2,147,483,648).
 
 - SOME COMPILERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GREATER PRECISION OF CURRENT
   VARIABLE VALUES IN A REGISTER AS OPPOSED TO THE LESSER PRECISION OF
   THE VALUE WHEN RELOADED FROM MEMORY.  A DIFFERENCE IN PRECISION MAY
   OCCUR BECAUSE THE PRECISION OF THE DATUM IS GREATER IN A REGISTER
   THAN IN MEMORY.  UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS PROGRAM DEDNM IS SENSITIVE
   TO DIFFERENCES IN PRECISION OF COMPUTED VARIABLE VALUES WHEN THEY ARE
   USED DIRECTLY FROM THE REGISTER AS OPPOSED TO BEING RELOADED FROM MEMORY.
   TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESULTS THE USER SHOULD SET THE SWITCH OF THE
   COMPILER TO CONSISTENTLY CHOOSE THE MEMORY REFERENCE PRECISION FOR
   NON-INTEGER OPERATIONS, IF AVAILABLE.  IF NOT AVAILABLE IT IS POSSIBLE
   THAT THE VERIFICATION TESTS PRODUCE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RESULTS DUE TO
   ROUNDING ERROR.
 
 - SOME OPERATIONS IN TOPAZ ARE PERFORMED AT THE DOUBLE PRECISION LEVEL (SUCH
   AS SUMMATIONS OF SMALL AND LARGE VALUES).  AFTER COMPLETION OF THE
   OPERATIONS THE RESULT IS CONVERTED BACK TO SINGLE PRECISION.  THE
   INTRINSIC FUNCTION FOR BACK CONVERSION TRUNCATES THE DOUBLE PRECISION
   TO A SINGLE PRECISION NUMBER.  IT DOES NOT ROUND THE NUMBER!
   AS A RESULT, DOUBLE PRECISION NUMBERS SUCH AS 4.44999999 ARE TRUNCATED
   TO SINGLE PRECISION VALUES OF 4.449999 EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD HAVE
   BEEN ROUNDED TO 4.450000.  THIS MAY, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, LEAD
   TO A SLIGHT ROUNDING ERROR AS THE VALUE IS PRINTED WITH A LIMITED
   NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT DIGITS.
