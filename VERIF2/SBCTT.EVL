 NOTE 1: - FOR THE CONDITION WHERE THE WATERSHED OUTLET IS A SIMPLE
           OR COMPLEX JUNCTION, AN ADDITIONAL SHORT CHANNEL LINK AND
           CORRESPONDING OUTLET NODE (WITHOUT A JUNCTION) IS ADDED AT THE
           WATERSHED OUTLET OF THE BINARY NETWORK.  AS A, RESULT THE TOTAL
           LENGTH OF THE INT. CHANNELS AND OF THE NETWORK IS SLIGHTLY LONGER,
           AND TOTAL DRAINAGE AREA IS SLIGHTLY LARGER.  PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM
           CHANNEL LENGTH AND AREA VALUES, SUCH AS DRAINAGE DENSITY OR SLOPE,
           MAY, AS A RESULT, ALSO DISPLAY A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WHEN COMPARED
           TO THE RASTER NETWORK.
           FOR THE CONDITION WHERE THE WATERSHED OUTLET IS A COMPLEX JUNCTION,
           ONE OR SEVERAL ADDITIONAL SHORT CHANNEL LINKS BEYOND THE ONE JUST
           DESCRIBED MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPLEX JUNCTION.
           THE SUMMATION OF ALL THE SHORT CHANNEL LINKS AND CORRESPONDING
           DRAINAGE AREAS THAT ARE CREATED AS DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTE 1
           WILL ALWAYS BE LESS THAN THAT OF ONE RASTER CELL.
 
 NOTE 2: - NUMBER OF CHANNEL LINKS, LENGTH, ELEVATION, SLOPE, DRAINAGE AREA,
           DENSITY, AND NETWORK COMPOSITION VALUES ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER
           OF ADDITIONAL CHANNEL LINKS DUE TO THE DECOMPOSITION OF COMPLEX
           JUNCTIONS INTO A SEQENCE OF SIMPLE JUNCTIONS.
 
 
 NOTE 3: - CHANNEL SUBCATCHMENT AREA INCLUDES ONLY THE CELLS DEFINING
           THE CHANNEL ITSELF.  THE BINARY NETWORK HAS NO CHANNEL AREA
           ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
